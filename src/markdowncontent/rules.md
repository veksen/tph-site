### Overview
Below you can see categorised server rules. It is strongly recommended that you follow our rules.
Since we are a very large server, we need to run a tight ship. That means that you should 
feel out what frequency other people are putting out before you join in on the fun. 


### Golden Rule
Don't be a pedant: Don't be the guy who argues all the time about meaningless trivia. It's better to be actually helpful than to score imaginary points.


### General Rules
1. Do not advertise.
This includes other servers, products or services that you stand to benefit from financially, your youtube channel or the like.
2. Do not be a dick.
If you make yourself particularly hard to deal with, if you pretend that you are better than anyone else, or if you are just in general very annoying and not a good fit for this server we will remove you. Permanently.
3. Use facts, not authority.
If you are going to provide anecdote or your own experience, that is fine, provided you don't pass it off as axiomatic. Quote sources when you are asked to.
4. Do not flame languages or other such technologies (e.g. text editors).
Doing so is reductive. If someone likes to use VB.Net or JavaScript or Vim, we surprisingly expect you to not jump down their throat about that. Doing so outside of regulated channels where staff have explicitly allowed the discussion for a short period of time is not allowed ( #poll-discussion is one such example of an okay place to talk about it provided the poll allows it )
5. Speak English only in the chat.
This speaks for itself, we do not expect staff to speak extra languages and we cannot moderate what we do not understand. Sorry.
6. Do not ask for free work.
This is not an advertisement platform. If you are going to take from this community, you are going to give back to it first. We do not care about your work if you do not care about us. Thanks.
7. Do not DM people who you have not built a rapport with.
This is self explanatory. Don't be a creep. Don't be a pest, ask questions in relevant channels. Someone's DM is not a relevant channel.
8. Do not talk about your infractions publicly.
If you are infracted, it's not a big deal. It's simply a formal warning - you can totally recover from that. If you disagree with a warning, DM an admin (Yes, this supersedes rule 7, but only for strike discussions). Complaining about infractions publicly will land you a mute or a ban. Don't pollute chat or other channels with these conversations.
9. Do not participate in spoonfeeding.
Do not ask to be spoon fed, do not spoon feed anyone.
10. Do not impersonate staff members
If you setup your account to impersonate a staff member's (e.g. steal their old avatar and name) we will give you 30 minutes from the time we find out about it for you to fix that.
11. Follow the directions of staff members to the letter
Most of us are here for our love of programming, so we like to do as much talking about programming and the like as possible. That being said, we really don't like intervening. But we especially don't like having to intervene twice. Please don't make us do that, thank you 


### Content Policy
Below is a list of things that you cannot talk about here. If a staff member cites you the content policy, please understand that they really mean stop talking about the thing you are talking about. I think you will find the list reasonable, as we construct it to be conducive to an environment which suits talking about programming and technology in absence of distractions.
1. No politics, religion, philosophy or other such topics.
This goes without saying. You don't make friends by talking to strangers about these topics. Your political views have nothing to do with how good of a programmer you are.
2. No NSFW content in any capacity
Always ask yourself "Would my boss be okay with this fullscreen on my monitor as he walked by?". If the answer is no, don't post it. The content here is meant to be pg13. Not pg15, not pg18 - if you wouldn't show it to your kid brother in front of your mother, it has no place here. No hentai, no porn, no anything like that.
3. No talk of suicide or depression
Sorry to say, but if you are depressed or considering suicide, that is terrible and we feel sorry for you, but we do not feel qualified to give advice, to moderate advice given, or anything of the sort. It would be absolutely unfair of me (Fox) to put that weight on the shoulders of the moderators here. So please, ring your local suicide hotline which you can hopefully find here: http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html (or by googling it)
4. No talk of pirating, reverse engineering, hacking, or other such illegal topics
Obviously if the TOS of a game explicitly allows you to do one of these things, you can talk about it, and if a moderator asks you to prove that it's okay for you to do so, you're expected to prove it. But for the vast majority of subject matter here, no. Don't talk about it here. Thanks.
5. Don't ask for relationship or life advice.
As annoying as it is for me to write this, do not ask about how to "get the girl" or whatever. This is not the appropriate environment. Go look for dating advice and the like elsewhere. Complicated, heavy life advice topics that are not explicitly career related are off limits here as well. We're just programmers, we're not miracle makers.
6. Do not bring other server drama here.
We do not care that you got banned on another server. Sorry, but not our problem. Take it up with that server's staff.
