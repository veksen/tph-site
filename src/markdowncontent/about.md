### What is The Programmer's hangout? 

The programmer's hangout (TPH) is a discord community geared towards programming. 
The use of the word "geared" here is important, because more accurately it's a discord
**for programmers** of all kinds. If you're a totally green noob with 5 lines of code 
under your belt, or if you're a veteran with 15 years of industry experience - TPH has a
place for you. More than that, there are over 13,500 people here. You can guarantee
you won't be the only person with your experience level on the server. 


### How do I join?
All you need to do is click (this link)[http://discord.gg/programming]. You also need a 
discord account. We recommend setting on up, then reading the **#rules-and-info** channel.
